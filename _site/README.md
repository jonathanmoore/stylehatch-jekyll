# Jekyll Site Structure

A simple test of Jekyll to develop the structure we need for the new [Style Hatch](http://stylehatch.co) site while maintaining simplicity with the Markdown files so that anyone on the team can push updates for new themes or support pages.  Over time this repository will turn into the full Style Hatch site.

The site structure is generated using the permalink YAML variable along with Liquid loops in the Markdown for section index pages.
