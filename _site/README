# Jekyll Site Structure

A simple test of Jekyll to see if we can develop the structure we need for the new [Style Hatch](http://stylehatch.co) while maintaining simplicity with the Markdown files so that anyone on the team can push updates for new themes or support pages.  Over time this repository will turn into the full Style Hatch site.
