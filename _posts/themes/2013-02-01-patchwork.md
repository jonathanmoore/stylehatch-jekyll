#PATCHWORK - FOR THE CREATORS AND CURATORS

The evolution of the perfect Tumblr theme featuring a grid layout continues with the release of Patchwork by Style Hatch.

With the minimal and featured post options you have more control over your blog’s layout. As a bonus, Patchwork features a truly responsive layout that responds flawlessly on mobile devices.



##FEATURED AND MINIMAL POSTS

With Patchwork you have two options to change up the way that you see the posts appear in the grid. Featured posts will appear twice as large as the rest of the posts in your grid, and minimal posts will display photo, photoset, panorama, video, and audio posts without the caption on your homepage.

**Featured Posts** - To feature any of your posts simply add a #feature or #xl tag to your post. In the customize menu you can add additional tags that you would like to use to trigger the featured size.

**Minimal Posts** - Adding a #minimal or #xs tag to any photo, photoset, panorama, video, or audio post will only display the visuals of the post in the grid. Hovering over a minimal post will display the usual like, comments, and permalink links. Additionally you have the option in the Customize menu to add additional tags to use for the minimal layout, and the option to automatically convert all your posts to minimal.

##RESPONSIVE LAYOUT

The types of devices and ways that people are viewing your blog are growing exponentially, so having a layout for your blog that adapts from the largest resolution monitors down to mobile views is important. Go ahead and try it out, resize your browser window down to get an idea of how the layout changes. We have tested and optimized

Patchwork was optimized for iOS devices (iPad and iPhone) but it should work for other mobile devices just the same.

##SOCIAL FEATURES

We realize you spend a lot of time on other platforms outside of Tumblr, so we have built in ways to display your recent tweets, Instagram feed, Disqus comments and easy ways to share, like and pin your posts on Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and Pinterest.

Additionally you will find a handful of social networks that you can link to in the Customize menu.

##CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

Our goal is to give you the creative freedom to customize Cadence to fit your personal style and genius. With the color options, background images, layout options and social integrations the flexibility is unlimited.

We can’t wait to see what you do with it! Send a link our way @stylehatch.

###COLORS

- Text - Change up the text color used for all of the posts.
- Title - By default all of the post titles are slightly darker than the text color, but you can change the title color used for h2 tags and text post titles.
Post Background - Change up the color of the post background from white to any color you like.
- Subtle - The subtle color is used for the footer elements, dotted line dividers and text-based UI elements.
- Accent - This sets the color of the links throughout the theme as well as the blocks of color for link posts, quotes, and your site title.
- Hover - This color option is a variation of the accent color that shows up when you hover over links.
- Text on Accent - For your blog title, link posts, and quote posts the text on accent color will appear on top of the accent color.
- Nav Bar Background - Set the color of the nav bar that is fixed to the top of the theme.
- Nav Bar Text - Change the color of the text that appears on the top nav bar.
- Background - Sets the overall background color of the blog. If you want a solid color, make sure you first clear out the background image if one is set.

###IMAGES

- Icon - By default the theme will use your Tumblr profile icon at the top left of the theme, but this option allows you to upload a different square icon.
- Logo - If you want to incorporate a logo or a header image at the top of the sidebar, use this option to upload an image. For standard resolutions it’s best to go with 250px wide, but for retina resolutions double the width to 500px.
Site Background - Upload a background image to be used for the theme. By default the background will title and repeat, but you can turn on the “Fill Background Image” option to have the image fill the background.

###OPTIONS

- Minimal Media Post - Checking this option will automatically turn all photo, photoset, panorama, video and audio posts into the minimal mode with the captions hidden for the grid layout.
- Grid Animations - Turn on or off the animations you see when the grid is reordered.
- Infinite Scrolling - By default you will see the standard next and previous pagination, but turning on the infinite scrolling will allow visitors to endlessly load all of your posts.
- Capitalize Titles - We think that the theme looks best with all the titles capitalized, but if you want to turn that off uncheck this option.
- Stretch Photos To Fit - This option will allow your photos to stretch and fill the entire width of the permalink pages. If you frequently post low resolution images you might have better results turning this off.
- Fill Site Background Image - Turning this option on will fill the background window to the entire height and width of the browser window.
- Show Group Blog Details - If you plan on using Patchwork on a secondary blog for a group blog turn this option on to show the list of authors and ‘posted by’ details.
- Show Social Links - If you’re not using any of the social media icons, Twitter follow button or Twitter embed turning this option off will hide it all together.
- Dark Social Icons - Turn this option off to load in the light social icons which work best when you use a dark post background color.

###CUSTOM TEXT

- Featured Post Tags - By default the featured post tags are set to featured, xl, but you can add comma separated additional tags that will trigger the featured post layout.
- Minimal Post Tags - By default the minimal post tags are set to minimal, xs, but you can add comma separated additional tags that will trigger the minimal post layout.
- Authors Title - Customize the title you see above the list of authors on group blogs.
- Liked Title - Customize the title you see above the most recent post you liked on Tumblr.
- Instagram Title - Customize the title you see above your recent shot on Instagram.

- Google Analytics ID - This theme has asynchronous Google Analytics tracking built into the theme, all you need to do is add your site ID to this option.
- Clicky ID - For realtime tracking of who is on your site right now, goals, campaigns and Twitter monitoring add your Click ID. Clicky does charge for their analytics and tracking, but I highly recommend it for people who are stats junkies. Sign up for an account with Clicky.

After selecting the font copy the standard code and paste this option into the customize menu. You will also need to copy the font family and paste it into the body, title or UI font family option.
Body, Title, and UI Font Family - Add a standard CSS font stack or Typekit CSS font name to control the body and title fonts.
